Scans bluetooth devices around to help you locate your missing stuff

Just a personal fun side project. As I keep misplacing my Apple pencil and there is no built-in feature from Apple to locate it, I figured I finaly had an excuse to try play with swift and swiftUI.

Uses CoreBluetooth and associated permissions the user needs to accept. 

Actual version: 

Scans devices around and displays a list showing their name (id it exists) and the signal strength.

Left TO DO:

- fine tune the refresh of the signal strength
- possibily to go on devices to get more info
- possiblity to shows which devices are already known
- possibility to add a favorite on devices


+ extra features that will come my way eventually
